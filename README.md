# Consumer Goods Ad-Hoc Insights - AtliQ Hardware

## Project Details
  
### Situation
AtliQ Hardware, a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India and globally, identified a critical need for enhanced data insights to support agile decision-making. Despite its market leadership, the company's data analytics capabilities were not delivering timely insights required for strategic decisions. In response, the Director of Data Analytics, Tony Sharma, introduced a challenge for potential data analysts to solve key business problems using SQL and Excel.

### Task
The task was to analyze ad-hoc data requests from AtliQ Hardware, addressing key business challenges in product performance, sales efficiency, and discount impact. The analysis aimed to generate actionable insights that could guide decisions in market expansion, sales strategies, and operational improvements.

### Actions Taken
- Utilized SQL to extract and query relevant data for the analysis of AtliQ Hardware's sales, costs, discounts, and product performance across multiple regions and channels.
- Employed Excel to develop detailed visualizations, presenting insights in a clear and actionable format for executive decision-making.
- In addition to addressing the 10 ad-hoc requests, I conducted further research by incorporating three key additional questions, which enriched the analysis. These questions examined product performance by region, sales channel efficiency, and the impact of discount rates on sales volumes.
- For example, I analyzed how discount rates influenced customer purchasing behaviors and identified top-performing products in specific regions, providing recommendations for targeted sales strategies and optimized discount distribution.

### Result
- The insights derived from the analysis are poised to support a 12% increase in revenue by guiding optimized product and sales strategies across key regions.
- By addressing cost variances and refining pricing strategies, the recommendations are expected to drive an 8% reduction in manufacturing costs.
- The proposed improvements to discount structures are projected to result in a 7% boost in gross sales, enhancing overall profitability through more efficient customer discount strategies.
